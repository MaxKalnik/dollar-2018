						<h1 class="article-title">Destinations Where Your Dollar Takes You<br>Further in 2018</h1>
						<p class="main-block__text-item">RewardExpert compared current exchange rates to exchange rates as of summer 2017 to determine in which countries your dollar has become more valuable, and in which countries it has become less valuable. Local prices of goods and services were included in order to determine which destinations are, on the whole, the most affordable.</p>

					<p class="under-title">
						Everything is relative in matters of money. Currency can increase or decrease in value due to any number of factors, from supply and demand and the banking system, to political events and beyond. Nowhere can we see the relativity of currency better than in exchange rates between currencies, which are notoriously subject to short-term fluctuations and long-term trends.
					</p>

					<p class="main-text">
						In order to get the most bang for your buck while spending it abroad, it is essential to keep tabs on the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies. If the dollar increases in value in a certain country that you’ve been dying to visit, it’d be a good idea to book your flight while your dollar will buy you more. Unless, of course, there’s a clear and persistent trend, such that you’d be willing to literally wager that it’ll be worth even more later. Conversely, you might want to take a pass on countries where the dollar is weak, and either move on to greener pastures, or bide your time.
					</p>
					<p class="main-text">
						RewardExpert looked at twenty countries around the world, all potential summer vacation destinations. Ten are countries where your dollar is increasing in value, and another ten are countries where it’s becoming less valuable. By comparing current exchange rates to exchange rates from one year ago, we determined how much each country’s currency has gained or lost value against the U.S. dollar. For each country, we also calculated estimated round-trip airfares, as well as a total dollar value for a representative sample of routine daily expenses.
					</p>

					<p class="main-text">
						Countries first appear ranked according to their year-over-year increase or decrease of currency value relative to the U.S. dollar, and then according to their overall affordability based upon a combination of the following factors: <span class="text-icon icon-daily-expenses">daily expenses</span>, <span class="text-icon icon-length-of-stay">length of stay</span>, and, of course, <span class="text-icon icon-currency-value">currency value</span> relative to the almighty dollar.

							<li>
								<span class="text-semibold">Overall affordability is largely independent of exchange rate fluctuations and trends.</span> You will find some of the cheapest prices in countries such as Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia, as their currencies lose value against the U.S. dollar. At the same time, you will see comparable, albeit slightly higher prices in Thailand, in spite of the fact that the Baht has increased by 5.85% in value relative to the dollar since last year.
							</li>
							<li>
								<span class="text-semibold">The length of your stay is the factor that most impacts the relative affordability of destination countries. </span> Many countries with the most inexpensive goods and services are quite far from the U.S. and quite costly to travel to and return home from. Over a long enough vacation you’ll recoup the cost of airfare. If, on the other hand, you can’t spend a month vacationing in an inexpensive South Asian country, it makes more sense to go with a less remote destination with higher prices.
							</li>
							<li>
								<span class="text-semibold">Overall, the dollar has performed poorly over the course of the past year.</span> There are strong indications that this is due to the policies and unpredictability of the executive branch of the U.S. government, more than anything else. Only in countries with marked political and/or economic uncertainties has the dollar done well.

					<h2 class="block-title">10 Countries Where Your Dollar is Getting More Valuable</h2>

					<p class="primary-text">
						This ranking represents the ten countries in which the U.S. dollar has gained significant value over the last year, including a breakdown of average expenses travelers may encounter in each country. Some of these countries may not be among the most affordable in comparison to others in our analysis, however if these destinations are on your bucket list, consider visiting this summer, given the increased value you’ll be getting for your money.

					<p class="main-text main-text--countries-upper">
						Expenses listed reflect the total of available local prices for goods and services in each of the following categories: restaurants, grocery markets, transportation, sports and leisure, and clothing and shoes. These are not intended to reflect expected daily expenses for a tourist, but rather, for purposes of comparing prices in each category from one country to another. Price data has been converted from local currency to U.S. dollars according to current exchange rates.

							<p class="countries__text">In the last year, no currency has devalued more than the Turkish Lira. The U.S. dollar is worth 28.39 percent more this year than it was last year, in part due to the still-ongoing aftermath of the attempted coup during summer 2016 and uncertainty in the region surrounding still war-torn Syria. As a result, the prices of common tourist expenses, such as dining, transportation, and for the travel-savvy, the price of the ticket for your flight home, are lower than ever.</p>

With its varied terrain, ranging from desert to endless steppes and the coast of the Caspian Sea, Kazakhstan has appeared on the radar as a tourist destination on the rise. The value of the dollar has skyrocketed in this nation, from which the first man was launched into space, resulting in a very favorable exchange rate against the Tenge. In fact, you can still, to this day, watch Russian spacecraft blast off from facilities on lands leased from the Kazakh government.</p>

This comes despite strong economic fundamentals in Indonesia, and has led to a central bank intervention to raise interest rates in this archipelago nation. While grocery and commodity costs are modestly higher than in Nepal, other costs are comparable, but only in Indonesia can you experience Balinese theatre at an exchange rate mediated discount.</p>

While day-to-day expenses are naturally higher in the Alps than in the Himalayas, it is considerably cheaper and easier to reach a European destination like Switzerland, particularly from the American east coast. This makes shorter vacations relatively more affordable if you keep your shopping in check—especially when it comes to clothing and shoes, which are unusually expensive here. Switzerland is the only nation that is entirely in Europe where the dollar has strengthened this year, so if a European getaway is your game, Switzerland is certainly in play.</p>

Changes on this scale amount to the exchange rate holding steady against the U.S. dollar, however, it will still result in your money going further this year, as you help stimulate the Kiwi economy. At any rate, the strength of the dollar here makes local prices lower than neighboring Australia.</p>

This, in combination with expensive flights and higher commodity prices than other nations in the region, makes Thailand a less affordable destination for the summer of 2018.</p>

While round-trip airfare to Eastern Europe, which has grown in popularity among international tourists in recent years, can be less expensive than to the Eurozone, this is not true of Croatia. In addition to higher ticket prices than neighboring nations, prices are higher in Croatia—at both this and last years’ exchange rates—than in other Eastern European destinations, such has Bulgaria and Romania.</p>

							<p class="countries__text">The U.S. dollar has lost ground to the Canadian dollar, declining in value by 3.96 percent, as markets respond to uncertainties consequent to the U.S. political situation. Under the leadership of Justin Trudeau, our northern neighbor is seen as a more reliable trade partner, and at very least, a more predictable one, leading to appreciation in the Canadian dollar. Expenses can start to add up on longer visits, however, for shorter vacations, even with a weak dollar, it can make as much sense to visit our northerly neighbor as our southern one. Nevertheless, this year may not be the year to visit,unless you happen to live close to the border.</p>

As with many other nations, relatively stable internal politics and economic policy, combined with a fickle U.S. leadership, has led to appreciation in local currency values against the dollar. While airfare is cheaper than elsewhere in Europe, and commodity prices remain low, this year might be one to take a pass on Bulgaria due to the weakness of the dollar. Another year, the same price might fetch a more luxurious getaway.</p>

Prices will be higher than they were last year, due to the dollar’s loss of 3.73 percent of its value to the Pula. Accounting for exchange rate fluctuations, the prices of most goods and services in Botswana are comparable to Romanian prices, but with estimated round-trip airfares coming out to nearly twice as much, Botswana ranks 19th out of 20 in overall affordability, as compared to Romania’s 11th place showing.</p>

That is, at least if a long flight and the chance of a more favorable exchange rate in the future aren’t enough to deter you, which should certainly be enough to make you think twice. Like other highly developed, affluent destinations, affordability declines sharply with increased discretionary spending, and even more so at this year’s exchange rate.</p>

With cheaper airfare between the U.S. and Romania, Romania remains in the running for an Eastern European vacation and wins out over both Bulgaria and Croatia in our overall affordability ranking.

With typical prices of key goods and services significantly higher than those seen in Western Europe and much of the developed world, and a long, expensive flight between the U.S. and Australia, take a pass on the Outback and consider New Zealand this summer instead.</p>

					<img class="methodology__img" src="images/svg/methodology.svg">

					<p class="main-text">Flight prices were calculated by multiplying the mileage from New York City to the country's capital by Kiwi.com's flight price index value for the price per 100 kilometers for both outbound and return flights. Outbound airfare estimates were calculated according to U.S. prices in U.S. dollars, while return flight airfare estimates were calculated based upon the country’s average price figure, taking exchange rates into account. These are estimates and will almost certainly differ from actual ticket prices.</p>
					<p class="main-text">Exchange rates as of May 31, 2018, were compared to rates on the same day of 2017 to determine countries with currencies that have significantly gained or lost value against the dollar over the course of the past year. We selected ten out of the twenty countries with the greatest currency exchange rate gains against the dollar, and likewise, ten out of the twenty where the local currency lost the most value relative to the dollar.</p>
					<p class="main-text">We then incorporated crowdsourced figures detailing the average prices of various goods and services in each country and used the combined cost of selected daily expenses, such as meals, beverages, and transportation, to arrive at figure representative of overall daily expenses in each country.</p>
