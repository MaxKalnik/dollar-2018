						Summer travel season is officially here. Students unshackled from finals are free to roam around the world and workaday types of all sorts put in hard-earned vacation days to do some international unwinding. These foreign romps aren’t cheap and it’s important to know how far your dollar will get you wherever you’re planning to travel. A cappuccino that might cost more than five bucks in Iceland could run you less than $2.00 in Czechia.
					</p>

					<p class="main-text">
						A variety of factors affect the exchange rate and how much your dollar gets you. Exchange rates fluctuate relatively constantly, and it’s a good idea to keep an eye on whether they’re moving up or down. If your dollar is becoming more valuable in a certain country, you may want to pull the trigger on a vacation there while your buck is strong. And vice versa, waiting it out on a spot where your dollar is getting you less might help give you a lusher vacay on a smaller budget down the road. 
					</p><br/><br/>

					<p class="main-text">
						RewardExpert looked at ten summer vacation destination countries where your dollar is getting you further and ten countries where it’s becoming less valuable. We compared exchange rates from this year and a year ago to see where your dollar increased or decreased in worth. In these locales, we used several sources to break down what you can expect to pay for a <span class="text-icon icon-dining">night out</span>, <span class="text-icon icon-groceries">groceries</span>, <span class="text-icon icon-transit">transit</span>, <span class="text-icon icon-recreation">leisure</span>, <span class="text-icon icon-shopping">shopping</span>, <span class="text-icon icon-hotels">hotels</span> and <span class="text-icon icon-flights">flights</span> so that you can better plan your next summer expedition.

						<ul class="key-findings__list">
							<li>
								In terms of an expensive trip, <span class="text-semibold">Iceland</span> is #1 with a bullet. For example, a night out in Iceland is, on average, far more expensive than any other country on the list. Dinner and drinks for two at a mid-tier restaurant runs about $140.00, which is <span class="text-semibold">23.1% more expensive</span> than the second-most expensive night out, in Norway.
							</li>
							<li>
								On the opposite end, <span class="text-semibold">Poland</span> is definitely the cheapest vacation spot by far. It ranks toward the top in cheap food, cheap public transit and, in particular, cheap hotels. In terms of lodging, Polish hotels run an average of <span class="text-semibold">54.3% cheaper</span> than those in Iceland.
							</li>
							<li>
								Government policy has a big effect on your traveler’s checks. Iceland’s efforts to strengthen Krona values have made the dollar 19.6% less valuable there since last year. At the same time, political currency devaluation has made the dollar <span class="text-semibold">13.5% more valuable</span> in <span class="text-semibold">Argentina</span> during that twelve-month period.
							</li>
							<li>
								In the past year, it’s gotten cheaper to vacation in the <span class="text-semibold">Western European</span> countries on the list, but it’s still really expensive there, especially in Scandinavian countries. The dollar has become more valuable in three Western European countries (Norway, UK and Sweden) by an average of <span class="text-semibold">5.6%</span>, but countries like Sweden and Norway still are near the top of most expense categories.
							</li>
							<li>
								Despite any growing relative values of the US dollar, less-developed nations are still cheaper to vacation in, almost across the board. <span class="text-semibold">The United States</span>, with its outsized warehouse club and e-commerce sector, has lower shopping prices than any other country. China, Czechia (formerly known as the Czech Republic), Poland and Venezuela top every other category in terms of cheap travel.
							</li>
							<li>
								The more well-developed nations generally have the most expensive amenities, but don’t think that always means cheaper flights. Nations with well-funded infrastructure can leverage operating efficiency and offer cheaper airfare. <span class="text-semibold">South Africa, Sweden</span> and the <span class="text-semibold">US</span> are three of the five <span class="text-semibold">cheapest</span> countries for flights. The UK and Norway are also in the top 10 in the category.
							</li>
							<li>
								<span class="text-semibold">Airbnb</span> can help save cash-strapped travelers some dough on vacations in any of our chosen summer getaway spots. On average, a rental property in the capital city of these countries runs <span class="text-semibold">$62</span> less per night than a hotel. All in all, Airbnb listings cost less than the average hotel in every country.

A strong Hong Kong economy has kept these currencies mainly stable. Most notably, hotels in this densely packed nation are tough on a traveler’s pockets. However, Airbnb prices there are about half as expensive as hotels, saving travelers the largest expense on their trip.</p>

						<sup class="reg">*</sup> We show your best price from Kayak.com with next options: from 01 August to 14 August for 2 people in the economy class, roundtrip. If you want to review

					<p class="main-text">We looked at exchange rates for the week of May 19th in both 2016 and 2017 to determine the 20 countries that have gained the most currency value against the dollar and the 20 that have lost the most during that year. Exchange rates were gathered with x-rates.com. Then, a number of average prices were gathered with Numbeo.com for price categories crucial to the average traveler. Every figure that was more than 10.0% above or below the average was cross-checked with either a BEA producer price index figure or an industry association, such as PintPrice.com. This allowed all outliers to be
					double-checked to account for potential errors in crowdsourced data from Numbeo. Hotel figures were gathered from the Hotel Price Index and flight
					prices were gathered from Kiwi.com’s aviation price index. Countries without flight or hotel data were gathered using approximated averages with
					likewise countries. Airbnb prices were gathered by zeroing in on the postal codes associated with the countries’ capitals and taking an average price. Total flight prices were gathered using the aviation price index and multiplying the average figure by the miles between New York City and the countries’ major airport hubs.</p>
